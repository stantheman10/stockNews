## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
# HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
# HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

print(abs(diff))

per = (abs(diff) / float(close_value_yest)) * 100

print("5% of yestersdays stock is ", per)

if per > 5:
    print("Get News")

    ## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME.
    # HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
    res = requests.get(NEWS_ENDPOINT, params=news_params)

            for article in three_articles
        ]

    print(formatted_articles)


## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
# HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.


# Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
